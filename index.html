                from the starting point. Initial cost to every node except the first,
                is infinity.

                1. Starting with the chosen node, update the cost of reachable nodes
                by taking minimum of ( (cost to reach the "coming from" node +
                difficulty to the visiting node), previously updated cost to the
                visiting node), set the "coming from" node as parent if the cost is
                less to come from that node. <br />
                2. Repeat the steps for reachable nodes in the sequence of least cost
                to most cost, until all nodes have been visited.
